* Notes about the licensing terms of this package

Not all files in this package have the same licensing terms. All files
are freely redistributable, however.

For commercial use of this software, you have to negotiate an
appropriate license with the University of Dortmund.

It is our intend that this software can be used as the basis for other
`free' software. If you find that you can't use it for your free
software project because of the licensing terms, please notify us.

The licensing terms are derived from the terms of CMU for their Mach
OS, but they are not the same.
